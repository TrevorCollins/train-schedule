# Choo Choo

## **Overview**
Choo Choo is a train scheduling web app. The user enters the name of a train, its destination, the time that it first departs from the station, and the frequency of which it makes its rounds. That information is then stored in a Firebase database. From that, the app displays the name, destination, and frequency, as well as the next arrival time and the how far away in minutes it is.
